# eDNA Data Analysis Workshop 2022

## Learning Outcomes:

1. Students are able to appropriately analyse data from an eDNA field sampling campaign;
2. Students are able to interpret and understand statistical outputs from the R package [vegan]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"}.

```{r set up, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(vegan)
library(flextable)
library(stringr)
library(magrittr) # for pipe syntax
set_flextable_defaults(theme_fun = "theme_zebra", font.size = 9)
```

## Import the data

**Notes**:

1. This code imports the data from a file where the **samples are rows** and the **species are columns**.
2. We convert the column [Site]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"} to a *factor* (categorical information in R)

```{r}
eDNA2022 <- read.csv(file = "eDNA2022.csv")
eDNA2022$Site <- as.factor(eDNA2022$Site)
```

If you have *species* as rows and *samples* as columns, we will need to do a bit
of wrangling!

```{r read and wrangle species as rows data, eval=FALSE}
speciesAsRows <- read.csv(file = "speciesAsRows.csv", row.names = 1)
speciesAsRows <- rbind(str_remove(colnames(speciesAsRows), "X"),
                       speciesAsRows)
row.names(speciesAsRows)[1] <- "SiteID"
speciesAsRows <- as.matrix(speciesAsRows) # convert to matrix for next step
speciesAsRows <- t(speciesAsRows) # t() means transpose
eDNA2022 <- as.data.frame(speciesAsRows)
eDNA2022$Site <- as.factor(eDNA2022$Site)
```

## List of all the species and their common names

```{r}
altnames <- 
  c("MosqFish", "Goby", "Mullet", "Bream", "BnjoFrog", "GToadlet", "MlrdDuck",
    "SpotDove", "SwampHen", "Crake", "WFHeron", "Lorikeet", "Cattle", "Sheep",
    "Mouse", "Rat", "HydroidB", "HydroidO", "BwnJelly", "MoonJely", "Dog")
names_table <- 
  data.frame(Taxonomic = gsub("."," ",colnames(eDNA2022[,4:24]), fixed = T),
             Common=c("Mosquito Fish","Bridled Goby","Gray Mullet","Black Bream",
                      "Western Banjo Frog", "Gunther's Toadlet", "Mallard Duck",
                      "Spotted Turtle Dove", "Purple Swamphen", "Spotted Crake",
                      "White Faced Heron", "Rainbow Lorikeet", "Cattle", "Sheep",
                      "Mouse", "Rat", "HydroidB", "HydroidO", "Brown Jellyfish",
                      "Moon Jellyfish", "Domestic Dog"),
             Abbreviated=altnames)
flextable(names_table,cwidth = c(3,2,2))
```

<hr>

We need to make a subset of our imported data which contains just the species
presence/absence information (not sample IDs, sites, reps). We also overwrite
the original column names with abbreviated names for better visualisation later.

```{r generate all species data, results='hold'}
allSpecies <- eDNA2022[,4:24] # not columns 1:3 which are sample IDs etc.
colnames(allSpecies) <- names_table[,3]
```

## Difference and Similarity measures

We start by assessing how similar or different our samples are – to do this we
need to set up a resemblance matrix. Ideally our 4 replicated samples are more
similar to one another than any other samples – but with field sampling this is
not always the case. To determine similarity we need to use a similarity
measure.

### Similarity Measures:
A similarity measure is conventionally defined to take values between 0 and 100%
(or 0 and 1) with the ends of the range representing the extreme possibilities:

- Similarity = 100% (*or 1*) if two samples are totally similar
- Similarity = 0 if two samples are totally dissimilar

What constitutes total similarity, and particularly total dissimilarity, of two
samples depends on the specific criteria that are adopted. For example most
biologists would feel that similarity should equal zero when two samples have no
species in common, and similarity should equal 100% if two samples have
identical entries. Similarities are calculated between every pair of samples
creating a similarity matrix. There are a number of similarity measures (ways to
calculate similarity) which can be used to create this matrix.

**Bray Curtis** and **Jaccard** are two different similarity measures we can use
-– both are commonly used in ecology and have desirable properties -– similarity
is calculated based on the taxa that samples have in common. Similarity takes a
value of 0 if two samples have no species in common and joint absences have no
effect (*i.e*. a taxon jointly absent in two samples does not contribute to its
similarity). The difference between them is that Bray Curtis will use abundance
information (where it is present) in assessing similarity, whereas Jaccard
converts abundances to binary (*i.e*. 0s and 1s, with 1 representing presence
and 0 meaning absence) to assess similarity. In our case it does not matter much
which we use, since we have already converted to binary – so let’s proceed with
Jaccard.

**Ecological Question – If two samples have no taxa present each does this make them more similar to one another?**

To assess similarity in the [vegan]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"} **R** package carry out the following steps. The
output shows the first few rows and columns of the dissimilarity matrix; each
number represents the Jaccard distance between samples based on the presence or
absence of species.

```{r dissim matrix all Jaccard, eval=FALSE}
AF_diss_all <- vegdist(allSpecies, 
                           distance = "jaccard") # default is distance = "bray"

# just look at the top corner of the dissimilarity matrix:
txt0 <- capture.output(print(AF_diss_all, digits=3)); txt0[1:10]; rm(txt0)
```

```{r dist matrix aquat bray output with cat, echo=FALSE}
AF_diss_all <- vegdist(allSpecies, 
                           distance = "jaccard")
txt0 <- capture.output(print(AF_diss_aquat,digits=3))
for (i in 1:11){ cat(txt0[i],"\n") }
```

# Ordinations

Next we will construct our ordination – a procedure to visualise the similarity
matrix by simplifying (scaling) it into fewer dimensions than our original data.
This reduction of dimensions is useful as the original data will have as many
dimensions as there are species, which is impossible to visualise! There are two
different types of ordination that we will use: **Multi-Dimensional-Scaling**
(nmMDS) and **Principal Coordinates Analysis** (PCO). If you have previously
used PCA -– Principal Component Analysis -- you may be familiar with ordination
methods. PCA is useful for environmental datasets -– these are represented by a
similarity matrix derived via use of Euclidean Distance as a measure of
similarity. PCA is more suited to environmental variables because of the type of
data – there are no large blocks of zeros (usually) and it is no longer
necessary to select a similarity measure that ignores joint absences. When
looking at ordination plots in general you should note that sample points that
are spatially located together share common characteristics and sample points
that are distantly located from one another share less characteristics. This
holds whether we are working with environmental variables (pH, EC, moisture
content, heavy metals *etc*.) or species abundances.

The main difference between MDS and PCO relates to the underlying use of the
resemblance matrix.

**MDS** takes the similarity measures calculated by Jaccard or Bray Curtis and
ranks them in order. Thus pairs are samples are ranked according to highest to
lowest similarity and are thus plotted in multidimensional space. Since it uses the rank and not the actual values, it's commonly called "non-[para]metric" multi-dimensional scaling, or **nmMDS**.

**PCO** takes the actual values of the underlying measure of similarity and
plots pairs of samples in multi-dimensional space. It will then look for the direction (vector) of greatest variance in the multi-dimensional "cloud" of points, which becomes the first PCO dimension. Successive dimensions explain the most possible remaining variance, until all variance is accounted for. So, many PCO dimensions are possible, but usually only the first 2 or 3 are useful for visualizing our data. 

For both types of ordinations the software attempts to preserve the similarity
of each pair of samples –- while this is feasible in multidimensional space, in
order for us to view the ordination we see this in 2 or 3 dimensions -– thus the
software attempts to preserve as much as is feasible of the sample pair
similarity as calculated –- but in reality we need to consider how much the 2-
dimensional view is a true representation of the data set. In nmMDS we use the
*stress* value to evaluate this, in PCO we can plot multiple axes, *i.e*. axis 1
*vs*. axis 2, axis 2 *vs*. axis 3 and so on. The amount of variance explained in
each PCO dimension is called the *eigenvalue*, and the output will include these
values; the greater the eigenvalue, the more useful a PCO dimension is. In
practice, much of the variability is often explained in the first two axes
(*i.e*. 2 dimensions) and we will limit our analysis to these axes for this
dataset.

## Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmMDS)

In vegan this is done using the [metaMDS()]{style="font-family: monospace;
background-color: #e8e8e8;"} function. We need to specify an input matrix of
just the species data (*e.g*. [allSpecies]{style="font-family: monospace;"}
which we made earlier). The default is to find 2 dimensions
([k]{style="font-family: monospace;"}) using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix,
but we can set these options to different values using [k =]{style="font-family:
monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"} and [distance =]{style="font-family:
monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"} options. The dissimilarity matrix is
calculated within the [metaMDS()]{style="font-family: monospace;
background-color: #e8e8e8;"} function, so for consistency we set [distance =
"jaccard"]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"}.

```{r run nmds all jaccard, results='hide'}
# default with 2 dimensions
AF_nmds_all <- metaMDS(allSpecies, distance = "jaccard")
# 3 dimensions for comparison
AF_nmds_all3 <- metaMDS(allSpecies, k=3, distance = "jaccard")
```

```{r show mds all jaccard}

# show output for 2 nmMDS dimensions
AF_nmds_all
```

The 2D stress value is $\approx$ 0.16. This can be interpreted as follows:

```{r fig.height=1., fig.width=6, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
par(mar=c(2,0,1,0))
plot(c(0,0.4),c(0,1),type="n",bty="n",xaxs="i",yaxs="i",xaxt="n",yaxt="n",xlab="",ylab="")
axis(1,at=c(0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3),labels=c(0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3));abline(h=0)
mtext("What's good stress? (for nmMDS)", adj=0.02)
abline(v=c(0.05,0.1,0.2), lty = 2)
text(c(0.025,0.075,0.15,0.3), rep(0.25,5),
     labels=c("excellent","great","good but caution",
              "maybe useful but potentially wrong . . ."),
     col = c("chartreuse4","blue","darkorange2","firebrick3"))
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
```

The stress value is relatively high as we are dealing with a large number of
samples with lots of 1s and 0s in a 2 dimensional space – resulting in a
challenging similarity environment.

$\Rightarrow$ Check the stress value of the 3-D ordination – is it lower? Remember that we made this object in the code block above:

```{r show mds all jaccard 3dim, results='hide'}
AF_nmds_all3
```

The following plot mimics the nmmds plot in Deirdre's handout (note that the
sign of dimension MDS2 is reversed)

```{r plot nmds all Jaccard 2D, fig.height=6.5, fig.width=6.5, out.width="70%"}
palette(c("black","grey60","grey42",
          rainbow(4,v=0.75,end=0.25),rainbow(4,v=0.75,start=0.45,end=0.8)))
plot(AF_nmds_all$points, pch=c(rep(21:25, 2),21)[eDNA2022$Site], 
     xlim = c(-1.6,2.2), ylim = c(1.2,-1.2), 
     bg=seq(1,11)[eDNA2022$Site], 
     cex = 1.4, main = "All species", col.main = "steelblue")
text(AF_nmds_all$points, labels=eDNA2022$SiteID, cex=0.9, pos = 4, 
     col=c("black","grey40","grey70",
           rainbow(4,v=0.75,end=0.25),
           rainbow(4,v=0.75,start=0.45,end=0.8))[eDNA2022$Site])
text(AF_nmds_all, display = "species", col = "#80008080", font=3, cex = 1.1)
legend("bottomright", inset = 0.01, box.col = 3, ncol = 4, title = "Site", 
       legend = seq(1,11), pch=c(rep(21:25, 2),21), 
       pt.bg = seq(1,11), pt.cex = 1.4, cex = 1.2)
```

You can play around with the code to make additional changes – you won’t
break it by trying so play around as much as you like. You will notice that
there are only 2 points for Site 2 – this is because the points are overlaid on
top of one another – as we are picking up only a few taxa some of the samples
are very similar to one another. However we can generally see that there are
sample groupings and that likely location has an effect (i.e. samples that are
from the same location are closer together). We will test this statistically a
little later.

## Principal Coordinates Analysis

In the 'vegan' package we use Weighted classical multidimensional scaling, also
known as *Weighted Principal Coordinates Analysis*. This is implemented using 
the function [wcmdscale()]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"}.

```{r}
AF_pco_all <- wcmdscale(vegdist(allSpecies), eig=TRUE)
AF_pco_all
```
```{r basic pco plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(AF_pco_all)
```

This is a basic PCO plot based on all species, showing the locations of
individual samples by row number.

We can make more informative plots by using the information stored in the
output object 
([AF_pco_all]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"}).

```{r better pco plot using base R, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, out.width="70%"}
palette(c("black","grey60","grey42",
          rainbow(4,v=0.75,end=0.25),rainbow(4,v=0.75,start=0.45,end=0.8)))
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(4,4,1,1), mgp = c(1.7,0.3,0), tcl = 0.25, 
    font.lab = 2)
plot(AF_pco_all$points[,c(1,2)], xlim = c(0.4,-0.6), ylim = c(0.4,-0.6), 
     pch=3, cex = 0.5, col = "grey")
text(AF_pco_all$points[,c(1,2)],labels = eDNA2022$SiteID,
     col=seq(1,11)[eDNA2022$Site])
mtext("first and second dimensions")
plot(AF_pco_all$points[,c(1,3)], xlim = c(0.4,-0.6), ylim = c(0.4,-0.6), 
     pch=4, cex = 0.5, col = "grey")
text(AF_pco_all$points[,c(1,3)],labels = eDNA2022$SiteID,
     col=seq(1,11)[eDNA2022$Site])
mtext("first and third dimensions")
```

```{r calculate pco scores but not sure if we need this}
AF_pco_scores <- scores(AF_pco_all)
```

# PERMANOVA

In order to test where location has a significant effect on the taxa at our
field site we need to run an ANOVA – however as we have multiple species to test
together we cannot run a basic ANOVA – we must run a multivariate permutational
ANOVA or **PERMANOVA**.

PERMANOVA shares some resemblance to ANOVA where they both measure the
sum-of-squares within and between groups, and make use of an F test to compare
within-group to between-group variance. However, while ANOVA bases the
significance of the result on assumption of normality, PERMANOVA draws tests for
significance by comparing the actual F test result to that gained from random
permutations of the objects between the groups. Moreover, whilst PERMANOVA tests
for similarity based on a chosen distance measure, ANOVA tests for similarity of
the group averages.

We could calculate a univariate measure of diversity (a Simpson or Shannon
index,  for example) and run an ANOVA on that univariate value. In doing so, however, we are reducing the complex dataset to a simplified version and losing
discrete information in the process. Remember that ANOVA also has an underlying
assumption of normality -– generally speaking, biological species data are not
normally distributed and thus do not satisfy this assumption. This makes
applying a permutational ANOVA a much better option. Before the advent of
computational capacity a permutational ANOVA would have taken quite some time to
run –- luckily now it only takes a matter of seconds to minutes depending on the
complexity of the dataset.

In the [vegan]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"}
package, 
the [adonis2()]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"}
function implements Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using
Distance Matrices (*i.e*. PERMANOVA).

We use a formula in the [adonis2()]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #e8e8e8;"} function which expresses the community matrix 
(*i.e*. the columns of species presence or absence) as a function of a factor 
(in this case, [Site]{style="font-family: monospace;"}).

```{r}
AF_permanova_all <- adonis2(eDNA2022[,4:24] ~ Site, data = eDNA2022,
                            permutations = 9999)
AF_permanova_all
```

P value by permutation = [0.0001]{style="font-family: monospace;
background-color: #e8e8e8;"} indicating a significant effect of location on the
community composition of our samples. Note that 9999 permutations were
undertaken to arrive at this value.

```{r pairwise Permanova, paged.print=FALSE}
source("FUN_pairwise_adonis2.R")
source("FUN_plain_pairwise.R")
AF_PWpermanova_all <- pairwise.adonis2(eDNA2022[,4:24] ~ Site, data = eDNA2022)
AF_plainPW_all <- plainPW(AF_PWpermanova_all)
colnames(AF_plainPW_all)[1] <- "Comparison.between.Sites"
flextable(AF_plainPW_all, cwidth = c(1.5,1)) %>% align(align="center")
```

**Notes**: 

- the pairwise Adonis2 source code is by Pedro Martinez Arbizu at https://github.com/pmartinezarbizu/pairwiseAdonis.
- The code for the [plainPW()]{style="font-family: monospace;"} function is as follows:

```{r plainPW function code, eval=FALSE}
# function inputs output object from Pedro Martinez Arbizu's pairwise.adonis2()
# code at https://github.com/pmartinezarbizu/pairwiseAdonis
plainPW <- function(PWobj) {
  UL_PW_perm <- unlist(PWobj) # convert list to long named vector
  names_PW_perm <- names(UL_PW_perm) # extract the names...
  rows_pvals <- grep("F)1",names_PW_perm) # find the rows we need
  justThePW <- # use the row indices to find the rown in the long vector
    data.frame(Comparison = str_remove(names(UL_PW_perm[rows_pvals]),
                                       fixed(".Pr(>F)1")),
               P_value = as.numeric(UL_PW_perm[rows_pvals]))
  return(justThePW) # and the resulting data frame is the output!
}
```

# Extras

### Stress plot for nmMDS based on Jaccard dissimilarities, all species

```{r}
stressplot(AF_nmds_all, main="Stress plot")
```

## Analysis with just the aquatic species

These are: *Gambusia holbrooki, Arenigobius bifrenatus, Mugil cephalus, Acanthopagrus butcheri, Limnodynastes dorsalis, Pseudophryne guentheri, Blackfordia polytentaculata, Obelia bidentata, Phyllorhiza punctata, Aurelia sp.*

```{r subset to just aquatic, paged.print=FALSE, results='hold'}
fish <- allSpecies[,c(1:6,17:20)]
head(fish)
```

### for interest look at the dissimilarity matrix

```{r dissim matrix aquat bray, eval=FALSE}
AF_diss_aquat <- vegdist(fish, 
                           distance = "bray")
txt0 <- capture.output(print(AF_diss_aquat,digits=3));txt0[1:10];rm(txt0)
```

```{r dist matrix aquat bray output with cat, echo=FALSE}
AF_diss_aquat <- vegdist(fish, 
                           distance = "bray")
txt0 <- capture.output(print(AF_diss_aquat,digits=3))
for (i in 1:11){ cat(txt0[i],"\n") }
```

```{r run nmds aquat Bray, results='hide'}
AF_nmds_aquat <- metaMDS(fish, trymax = 500, 
                           distance = "jaccard")
```
```{r show nmds aquat Bray}
AF_nmds_aquat
```
```{r plot nmds aquat Bray, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(AF_nmds_aquat, type="p",display = "sites", cex = 1.2)
text(AF_nmds_aquat, display = "species", col = "dodgerblue", cex = 0.8)
```

### alternative to vegan plots
```{r alt1 to vegan nmds plots, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
palette(c("black","grey80","grey92",
          rainbow(4,s=0.5,end=0.25),rainbow(4,s=0.5,start=0.45,end=0.8)))
plot(AF_nmds_aquat$points, pch=c(rep(21:25, 2),21)[eDNA2022$Site], 
     xlim = c(-1.2,1.8), 
     bg = seq(1,11)[eDNA2022$Site], 
     cex = 1.4, col.main = "steelblue", main = "Just aquatic species")
text(AF_nmds_aquat$points, pos = rep(c(1,2,4),4)[eDNA2022$Site], 
     labels=eDNA2022$SiteID, cex=1, 
     col=c("black","grey40","grey70",
           rainbow(4,v=0.75,end=0.25),
           rainbow(4,v=0.75,start=0.45,end=0.8))[eDNA2022$Site])
text(AF_nmds_aquat, display = "species", col = "grey33", font=3, cex = 0.9)
```

## Detrended correspondence analysis - all species

```{r}
AF_dca_all <- decorana(allSpecies)
AF_dca_all
```

```{r decorana plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(AF_dca_all)
```

## For comparison if wanted: nmMDS again with Bray-Curtis distances
```{r run nmds Bray allspecies, results='hide'}
AF_nmds_all_B <- metaMDS(allSpecies) # uses Bray by default
```

```{r show nmds Bray allspecies, results='hold'}
AF_nmds_all_B
```

The results should be identical to nmMDS with Jaccard, since the community
matrix is already converted to presence-absence (binary ones and zeros).
